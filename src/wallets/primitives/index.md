# Primitives

The Rusty Kaspa SDK provides a standard set of primitives required to build HD wallets. These primitives include:

- [Mnemonics](./mnemonics.md) – Mnemonic processing and private key seed generation following the `BIP-39` standard.
- [Key Management](./keys.md) – Cryptographic primitives for managing private and public keys using the `secp256k1` elliptic curve.
- [Derivations](./derivations.md) – Key derivation functionality using `BIP-32` and `BIP-44` standards.
- [Addresses](./addresses.md) – Kaspa address handling and validation.

The references in this section are not exhaustive but are intended to provide a starting point for developers to understand the basic building blocks of Rusty Kaspa wallets. A great way to dive deeper is by cloning the [Rusty Kaspa repository](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa) and using "find in files" to search for terms of interest.
