# Redistributables

WASM redistributables are available prebuilt for web browsers and for nodejs. The entire framework can also be built from Rusty Kaspa sources (into WASM) or used within Rust directly for Rust-based application integration.

You can download the latest stable version of the WASM SDK from:
[https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/releases](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/releases)
