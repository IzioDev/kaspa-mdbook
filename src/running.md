There are currently two full-node implementations for Kaspa, the original, developed in Golang and a new one called 'Rusty Kaspa', developed in Rust.  The Rust implementation has higher performance and it is expected that the Golang implementation will be deprecated.

Rust WASM framework can connect to the Rusty Kaspa node directly or to the Golang node via a Proxy.
