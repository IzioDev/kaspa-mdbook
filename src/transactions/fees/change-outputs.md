# Change Outputs


When creating transactions, it is important to observe the resulting amount of the change output. As a general rule, if your change output amount goes below 0.02, the output should be removed and the amount should be sacrificed to fees.

You can most certainly add additional inputs in an effort to raise the change output amount, but that will result in a slight compute mass increase and in general UTXO selection algorithm can become rather complex.
