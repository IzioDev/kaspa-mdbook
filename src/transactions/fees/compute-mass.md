# Compute Mass

Compute mass is derived from the overall transaction byte size as well as the number of SigOps required by the transaction script.

The implementation of compute mass calculation can be found in the [`kaspa_consensus_core::mass` module](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/blob/master/consensus/core/src/mass/mod.rs).
